# LZW_with_DLB
Adapted from my project in Algorithm course, it uses a modified de la briandais tree instead of the TST tree provided in Robert Sedgewick's "Algorithms"  

## key features
1. searching prefix and adding new codeword are done simultaneously.
2. compared to other implementations, this program is much shorter in length.
